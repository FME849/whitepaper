### Metacraft Studio

Long story short, Metacraft is a Decentralized Game Studio!

All started with the question “What does it take to create something with zero skill and knowledge of that field?” — Lots of time, by yourself, or, lots of helps, from everyone!

Triggered with that idea, and inspired by how Wikipedia was founded and growth by the contribution of the community, Metacraft, as a Decentrialized Game Studio, is a collective, or “tribe" as how we called ourselves, of individuals come from various backgrounds but connected at heart by curiosity, enthusiasm and the burning desire to create “interesting" stuffs.

Back in 2003, it would be lunatic if someone told Eul, a keen Warcraft 3 modder, that his game mod named Defense of the Ancients, later widely known as DOTA, will become a phenomenon and give birth to a whole new genre of video games: MOBA. Shorts for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, MOBA games are known as a major genre in eSports, with millions of fans worldwide and a market value of 43 billion USD by the end of 2021. It all started with just a game lover added what he likes to a game, shared it,  and the rest was history.

At Metacraft, we believe games should be made by game lovers, for game lovers. And that's what we do!

Our vision is to push this idea even further by **empowering everyone with the ability to co-craft anything they want** using Metacraft Framework and Contributors will be appreciated fair and square for their contributions via a decentralized, transparent blockchain-backed system.

The focus of Metacraft Studio through out 3 stages are going to be:

- **Stage 1**: Focusing on building `ATEM` world lore and its games series using Metacraft Framework.
- **Stage 2**: Battle-testing the Metacraft Framework by allowing developers developing their games based on the `ATEM` World, using the framework
- **Stage 3**: Authorizing the control of Metacraft Framework to the next generation, chosen by the community. Metacraft Framework governance.
