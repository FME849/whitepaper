### Metacraft Studio

Long story short, Metacraft is a Decentralized Game Studio.

Back in 2003, it would be lunatic if someone told Eul, a keen Warcraft 3 modder, that his game mod named Defense of the Ancients, later widely known as DOTA, will become a phenomenon and give birth to a whole new genre of video games: MOBA. Shorts for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, MOBA games are known as a major genre in eSports, with millions of fans worldwide and a market value of 43 billion USD by the end of 2021. It all started with just a game lover added what he likes to a game, shared it,  and the rest was history.

At Metacraft, we believe games should be made by game lovers, for game lovers. And that's what we do!

Our vision is to push this idea even further by empowering everyone with the ability to co-craft anything they want and contributors will be appreciated fair and square for their contributions via a decentralized, transparent blockchain-backed system.

To bring our vision to life, Metacraft team is developing [Metacraft Framework](https://github.com/cocrafts/whitepaper/blob/master/metacraft/framework.md) and applying this framework to create our game series.

Metacraft Framework, explained in simple language, is a virtual [collaboration space](https://www.notion.so/Whitepaper-SG-4c33c0dfa00b48a6bca38239baf44707) where everyone can find various methods to contribute what they can toward the development of a project. It could be a line of code, an artwork, a hand sketch, or a piece of copywriting...

We strongly believe by deploying this framework, as project owners, we also unlock the ability of fast scaling and lean operation while still exciting our contributors when they can try any roles they want, and get the benefit for every contribution they've made, even the smallest. And by operating blockchain technology, we're doing the best to our ability to keep things as transparent and fair as much as we could.

With Metacraft Framework, you can be anyone, and create anything!
