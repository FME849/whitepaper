### Contributor
At Metacraft, Contributor is the BRAIN.

Contributor is the crowd community and is the true builder of all games, novels and beyond which happens at [Stormgate.io](http://Stormgate.io). Start from the idea of “decentralized” Game Studio, it is not only core team of 5 or 100 employees recruited to work on the game; it’s the crowd who are gamers or enthusiasts know what is the games should be and interested in ATEM. 

Contributor could be anyone, any background, any age. They could be Student at age of 15, a Construction Builder love computer and coding, a retired Lawyer who still enjoys working, or a Housewives who love drawing and writing, and many more. As long as one has Internet and a mobile device/desktop, everything is possible.

What Contributor contribute at Metacraft is not limit. From the idea for the lore, art, game, etc… as can draw small icon, design some buttons on website, find the issues/bugs on games, write short paragraphs for chapter of novel, or help anybody in the community to onboard with Metacraft. Together, Contributor (and Core team) together build and play games and beyond on a **Collaboration Platform**, the place we made this idea come true, will be built on [stormgate.io](http://stormgate.io) Free to join and open, every contribution, no matter how small, is appreciated and rewarded by  `MEMI` token selectively for their value through an open-source algorithm.

If it is "work" purpose only, we have many tools around, but imagine one place where anyone could make something fun, interesting, enjoyable, and no work-mode. In early days with limited resources, we just use whatever ways or tools available to help us represent the ideas with other Contributors and get them onboard. So Notion and Discord turned out the most visible and easy to start with. Classic is the best, still.

Collaboration Platform won’t be the perfect version from the beginning, we have started step by step a bit day by day, so MVP version is:

- Forum-like model, where Contributors are able to create new thread easily
- Feel free to discuss and reply
- Be able to follow somebody or some topics that they are interested in
- Be able to show their emotion (reaction function)
- Simple User profile page

We are proud that we have contributors from the 1st day of Metacraft until now. So till the day Collaboration Platform is live on [stormgate.io](http://stormgate.io), anyone can visit [our website](https://stormgate.io/), [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/sXcz9Em4AR) and start following us and give their ideas anytime want.
