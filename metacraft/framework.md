# Metacraft framework 
Metacraft is a co-creation framework where massive amount of co-creator (called Contributor) gathered and create a product that they love to use as a user -
in this case, create ATEM universal with different Games, Novel and related child projects.

We have a strong belief that Game should be made by Gamer, not Programmer.
In the real world, this rarely happen - ATEM should be built by Gamer, who maybe amateur Programmer, Artist or Writer who interesting in write the fictional story for this world.

# Essential pillars
- [Tokenized economic](#tokenized-economic)
- [Public company](#public-company)
- [Core team](#core-team)
- [Co-creation](#co-creation)

# Tokenized economic
Even though the community gathered for fun and mainly to create project we love - without a sustainable economic engine, this could not go far.

The project backed by cryptocurrency - this case named Metacraft Mineral (MEMI), any contributor receive MEMI as reward for their contribution,

# Public company
Cryptocurrency may carry the financial part at early stage.   
But alone, it wouldn't enough - community will also launch a public company represent by top Contributor and Game players from the community - the Counsel (who love and understand Metacraft the most)

This company main focus is to make profit from the ecosystem that the community own - employee, including CEO work under monitoring of the Counsel.

Every five year, the top Contributor and Players re-vote new leader for the Public company.

# Core team
The fact, in the early days of Metacraft - no one actually care about it, except the pioneer who really want to kickstart it.

Those pioneer may use their finance/effort to drive ATEM til the day it got [tokenized](#tokenized-economic) - they'll be the first generation who run the public company in 5 years as soon as it established.

This core team, also drive the early community until the community know how to run itself.

# Co-creation
Beyond the core community, anyone from the crowd who wish to contribute to Metacraft also got rewarded by their activities on Github - by `MEMI`.

They could just contribute to earn MEMI or, in the best case become part of the core community and spread the fun.

Talented member from the community (Contributor, Player, or people with special expertise) will be invites to the core team. Or even be come the next "CEO" (we called Chieftain of the Tribe).
