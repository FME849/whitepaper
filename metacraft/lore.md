### Lore

To enter ATEM, players will need to walk through the magical portal, Stormgate, and find themselves in a medieval-themed, fictional world has been long sunken in wars, conflicts and chaos. Factions are busy wrenching their thirst for wealth, power. Meanwhile, the greater, darker force is going to take over this world. The future of ATEM is in the hands of the players!

In the first release of our game series, Under Realm: Rise of Magic, steel and brute force were the main material of the savage battles until mysteriously, mankind discovered the long-lost scripts that allow them to summon mighty, ancient creatures/ entities that can turn the tide in no time. And no one wants to be left behind. Adventurers across ATEM are desired by factions to discover the darkest, deepest dungeon all over the continent. 

All games of Metacraft are linked to each other and represents a period of ATEMâ€™s history. And players/ contributors are more than welcomed to join us co-creating ATEM world!
