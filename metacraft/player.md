### Player
User is the Heart of any product, Under Realm: Rise of Magic is no exception! We firmly believe our players and community are the key for us to break through and we aim to have our  game truly owned, designed, built by the players, for the players. 

In Metacraft universe, a player does not just simply play the games. Rather than just a vague statement, by developing and applying the [Metacraft Framework](https://github.com/cocrafts/whitepaper/blob/master/metacraft/framework.md), we actually create a clear path and protocol for our players to actively involved in the development and improvement of the games. It could be as simple as adding a new soundtrack, a witty script, or create a whole universe as they want with the help of the Metacraft community.

By the release of our first game Under Realm: Rise of Magic Alpha version in Q4, 2022, lots more fun is coming and you can sign-up for the waiting list [here](https://stormgate.io/).
