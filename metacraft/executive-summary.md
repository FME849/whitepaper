### Executive Summary 

“What does it take to create something with zero skill and knowledge of that field?”

Lots of time, by yourself, or, lots of helps, from everyone! 

Triggered with that idea, Metacraft, as a Decentrialized Game Studio, is a collective, or “tribe" as how we called ourselves, of individuals come from various backgrounds but connected at heart by curiosity, enthusiasm and the burning desire to create “interesting" stuffs.

To enable our vision, we have our own proposal called [Metacraft Framework]. It is a complex process to bring to life a simple goal — Allow anyone , from anywhere, with any background, skill set, to easily join co-crafting the Metacraft Universe. By rewarding contributors with the project's token: $MEMI, we are also able to appreciated fairly and transparently our contributors community for  their contribution  toward the growth of the project.

It must be noted that, as with all complex systems under active development, the contents of this guide and the technology they explain are both subject to change. In fact, one of the hallmarks of the Metacarft approach is rapid and pragmatic iteration. The latest update regarding the protocol can be found in our Discord.

Welcome to Metacraft Universe, Adventurers!
