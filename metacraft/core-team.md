### Core Team
Core team is Metacraft’s gatekeeper. We have Player as Heart, Contributor as Brain, and Core team as Gatekeeper to make sure that everything is developed in the right direction. 

5 years per time, Chieftain, Dedicate & Core Team will be chosen again by the community from top Contributor/Player. And who joined Core Team the previous time, cannot be voted in the next time. And of course, if anything is wrong, Community can kick them out anytime.

Metacraft’s 1st core team started the project since late Dec 2021 with 2 members working partially, and until the initial fund of >$130K from ~70 angel investors raised through Private sale #1 in March, we have gathered more members and officially kicked off the project in May 2022.

Our current core team members are ex-colleagues who all have been working in tech for years, while one of our Co-Founder & Lead Engineer used to work in a world’s leading NFT game company. Developers, QA, Brand/Marketing, Generalist, Community, Data Analyst, Gamers are our people. We strongly believe we have a good team with disruptive ideas and view into blockchain and excellent execution.
