### Metacraft Framework
Metacraft Framework, explained in simple language, is a virtual `collaboration space` to strengthen the mutual connection of GameFi Developers, Players, Builders…

Metacraft Framework unveil the ability of fast scaling and lean operation GameFi Developers, simplify the process of creating a GameFi Project. While still exciting the contributors when they can try any roles they want, and get the benefit for every contribution they've made, even the smallest toward any GameFi projects they want. And by operating blockchain technology, we're doing the best to our ability to keep things as transparent and fair as much as we could.

By using this Framework while developing their game, GameFi developers also got the `Fi` part (finance) covered at certain level. So they can really focus on making their game, it will have all necessary GameFi utilities, that widely accepted by Metacraft community.

Inspired by the idea “Amateurs together craft a universe” — Metacraft is truly owned by its community.

At `Stage 1`, Matacraft Studio will develop its game series, `ATEM`, using this framework. This is to battle-test Metacraft Framework before sharing it to other developers, studios to create a playground for GameFi creators with limited resource, so they can really focus on build games and make it a joyful journey.

The Framework comprises of four pillars:

#### 1. Collaboration Platform

An application on `iOs`, `Android` and web `Browser` that could be access from anywhere by smart devices.
Backed by `Wiki` engine/idea — on this platform Game creator, like engineer, artist, writer.. got reward with `MEMI` by contribute their effort/expertise toward the game development.

This is also a lean “social network” where conversations happen, to gather feed back from player to builder, to construct healthy ideas, gossip about game experiences — or anything thing related to Build and Play games. Constructive discussion with traction will get tiny amount of `MEMI` as reward to encourage healthy conversations.

#### 2. Governing System

Metacraft came with the promise to be truly owned by the community, no one is able to own it for themselves. Governance mechanism of Metacraft inspired by the democracy system, where the Chieftain voted by its community — in this case, they're top builders and players who spend most of their time to creator/build/contribute to Metacraft in different ways.


**Machine centric**:<br>
Mechanism to choose top builder and player will be machine centric, thanks to the `Collaboration Platform`. There will be an opensource code/algorithm to extract/calculate “reputation point” for creator/builder/player based on their contribution activities and interaction of the community on their stuffs (e.g. like, up-vote count). This mechanism won’t be perfect, nothing is — however it is transparent and neutral, the community themselves contribute on this algorithm and adjust it together.

**Core team**:<br>
The guardian of community, came from community — anyone inside community could be part of the core team.

On `Stage 1`, founder of Metacraft project will act as the 1st generation core team, and actively recruit talent from the community. Once the Framework mature enough to be inherits by the next generation, chosen from top talent of the Metacraft community — 1st generation will giving up the power, and start the democratic loop.


**Metacraft Foundation:**<br>
Metacraft Foundation owned by the community, top Builder and Player will act as the Counsel to choose a core team (and its Chieftain) for the Foundation every 5 years, except in the 1st core team generation, Counsel did not exist yet.

Even though core team and Chieftain operate the Foundation during their prorogue, they do that under monitoring of the Counsel and Community — corrupted core team could be kicked out by raising vote.

#### 3. Tokenomic

Even though Metacraft community gathered to build and play games, ultimate goal is having fun/joyful time together — without a sustainable economic engine, this could not go far.

`**MEMI**` (Metacraft Mineral) is Metacraft’s utility token on `SOLANA` with certain behavior/allocation designed to serve Metacraft community in general. `MEMI` will be integrated in to most Metacraft projects and benefit from buy/burn of fees.

At Metacraft, `MEMI` did not play the role of a governance token — its holder have no right to decide the direction of community, only top Builder, Player and influencer who spend most of their time contribute to Metacraft have this privilege.

#### 4. Open Infrastructure

All engineering activity under Metacraft project is opensource, Metacraft engineer build and share common architecture/library as opensource or free-to-use tools for game creator, builder and maybe for player also.

**Metacraft currently working, but not limited on following opensource:**

- [Cross-platform UI library](https://github.com/cocrafts/metacraft-ui) written using React Native that could run everywhere, including Browser
- [CLI for rapid development environment](https://github.com/cocrafts/metacraft-cli) (for Application, Api, Smart Contract developement with `TypeScript` and `Rust` — in the long run, this is like Remix of Ethereum)
- Customizable NFT Marketplace compliance with Metacraft convention
- Smart contract for NFT miniting compliance with Metacraft convention
- Token issuing tool for non-developer
