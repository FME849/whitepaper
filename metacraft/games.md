### Games

We desire to, together with community, develop multiple games with different genres, from 2D (turn-based) to 3D (MMO RPG). But not only game itself, we believe great games with exceptional gameplay need a great story behind, which is why the lore is created. Hence, all games are built and connected to each other, and each will represent a period of the ATEM world history.

At early stage like with a small team of full-time 5 people, we choose to kick-start the very first game with a “not much challenging” 2D type which is a turn-based Trading card game named **Under Realm**.

There are 3 reason behind this decision:

1. **Board game lover**: We, the core developer member, love Board games like Uno, Exploding Kittens, Monopoly and the legendary childhood YugiOh! - from a collect very cheap fake paper card to a Computer version; Hearthstone. Easy to onboard but hard to be a good player, friends time together, card collection, etc. are all we can recall those happy moment. We even normally create new rules when playing these board games, so we do the same to Under Realm.
2. **"Comfortable" entry for 1st-time game developers**: Speaking of engineering part, our core developers have never ever built a serious commercial game and this is our first time officially. Understanding game industry is not a joke, 2D seems to be a good entry point for such 1st-time and amateur game developers to the this industry. However, with the base of a pretty good engineer background of 10+ years experience, we hope that struggles and challenges are a bit let. For this reason, we’re developing Under Realm with [Cocos Creater](https://www.cocos.com/) - “A mature open source cross-platform game development framework” and free, so anyone can easily join Under Realm development journey with us.
3. **Huge and long live market**: Card game, to us, is a legendary and a lot of people love card games (at least to us). Card game existed since old times, some research said it was invented during the Tang dynasty around the 9th century AD as a result of the usage of woodblock printing technology; and it still existing today in many ways and the market size is massive. Global board games market (including card game) was valued at USD 13.75 billion in 2021, and it is expected to reach a value of USD 30.93 billion by 2028, at a CAGR of 13.70% over the forecast period (2022-2028) (SkyQuest, 2022). So, all we hope is to be simply one of small guy in this big market, creating another interesting game play for the Under Realm in blockchain space, that we love to play by ourselves first, and we hope existing card game lovers and others love it too.

Under Realm, the very first game of Metacraft Studio, is going to be developed mainly by the Core members. Even though operating a “Decentralize game studio”, we’re fully aware of that we need to develop Under Realm by ourselves and get it released firstly before more and more people know about and join together. Luckily, by today writing this White paper in August 2022, we’re thankfully having 20+ Contributors who are contributing their time and effort and sharing their passion to work on Under Realm with us: from Lore development, Character development, Sketching, Digitalize, etc., or just simply came playing hand-cut Under Realm paper version with us and leave helpful feedbacks. They have been with us since very early days and more coming along the way till now, and hopefully in the very near coming days.

#### UNDER REALM

Under Realm takes place in a chaotic, fragmented world of ATEM where human and other races are constantly fighting each others, to wrench the endless thirst for power, wealth, and gradually take control over ATEM.

Steel, blood and brute force were the main material of the savage battles until mysteriously, mankind discovered the long-lost magical scripts that allow them to summon mighty, ancient creatures/ entities that can turn the tide in no time. And no one wants to be left behind in this race. Adventurers across ATEM are desired by factions to discover the forgotten dungeons across this continent. Players join the Under Realm as Adventurers who will confront each other in the search for the long-lost scripts in hidden dungeon across ATEM.

Metacraft Minerals (MEMI) will be used to fuel and allow mankind to use magic, included and not limited to Summon ancient creatures from the sealed scripts and Create new scripts.

Under Realm is Trading card game with 2 modes, Free to play and NFT:
- **Free-to-play**: The main game mode where all players are able to purely enjoy the game with the original decks.
- **NFT**: Experimental mode where players can build, truly own and trade their decks while still keep the game balance on it own way.
