# Understanding cocrafts
Cocrafts is a co-creation framework where massive amount of co-creator gathered and create a product that they love to use as a user -
 in this case, create Metacraft universal with different games, novel and related child projects.

I have a strong belief that Game should be made by Gamer, not Programmer. 
In the real world, this rarely happen - Metacraft should be made by Gammers who maybe amateur Programmer, Artist or Writer who interesting in write the fictional story for this world.

# Essential pillars

- [Public company](#-public-company)
- [Core team](#-core-team)
- [Co-creation](#-co-creation)

# Tokenized economic 
Even though the community gathered for fun and mainly to create project we love.
Without a sustainable economic engine, this could not go far.

The project backed by cryptocurrency - this case named Metacraft Mineral (MEMI), `500,000,000` ownership pieces of the entire project.  
Any contributor receive MEMI as reward for their contribution,   

# Public company
Cryptocurrency may carry the financial part at early stage.   
But alone, it wouldn't enough - community will also launch a public company operate by top Contributor and Game players from the community (who love and understand Metacraft the most)

This company main focus is to make profit from the ecosystem that the community own - employee, including CEO work for the community (represented by top Contributor and Players).  

Every five year, the top Contributor and Players re-vote new leader for the Public company.

# Core team
The fact, in the early days of Metacraft - no one actually care about it, except the pioneer who really want to kickstart it.

Those pioneer may use their finance/effort to drive Metacraft til the day it got [tokenized](#-tokenized-economic) - they'll be the first generation who run the public company in 5 years as soon as it established.

This core team, also drive the early community until the community know how to run itself.

# Co-creation
Beyond the core community, anyone from the crowd who wish to contribute to Metacraft also got rewarded by their activities on Metacraft's Github - by `MEMI`.

They could just contribute to earn MEMI or, in the best case become part of the core community and spread the fun.
